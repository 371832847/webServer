I still remember the first time to stand in front of the platform， 
it was two years ago， I was arranged by my headmaster to get my internship， 
I would go to the countryside to be a teacher. When I arrived at the school， 
at first， I did not get used to the environment， but after a week， 
I got used to it. I was asked to teach the students English， 
I felt so never that night， I worried the students wouldn’t listen to me. In the morning， 
I had to start my class， my feet seemed to hard to move on. 
When I went to the platform， all the students looked at me， 
I was so nervous， then I introduced myself， as I went further in the class， 
I found myself felt much more ease， the students cooperate with me， 
I felt more and more confident. I learned so much from my first time to stand in front of the platform.
